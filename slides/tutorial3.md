## Agenda

Use and understand Scala!

I have prepared three little exercises for you to choose from: <https://github.com/dvdvgt/scala-exercises>

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Create a new branch to work on one of the exercises
3. Run tests to check whether your solution is correct: `$ sbt` and then `testOnly BstTest`
4. Push your branch once your confident with your solution
5. Open a pull request
